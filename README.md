Design Decisions In CS-300

When I design software, I like to start by imagining what I want the finished product to look and feel like. This project really helped me get better at turning ideas into something visual and interactive. Working on my 3D Halloween scene taught me to think about how simple shapes can come together to make something detailed and exciting. I learned how important it is to plan before building—deciding where objects should go, what colors and textures to use, and how light can make everything look more realistic. My process was very step-by-step: I built the shapes first, then added movement, texture, and lighting as I went. Each stage made the scene look more alive. I’ve realized that this same approach—starting simple, adding detail over time, and testing as I go—works really well for any design project, not just 3D graphics.

When it comes to developing programs, this project pushed me to organize my code better and think ahead. I tried new strategies, like keeping each object’s code in its own section and creating functions that I could reuse later. I also made sure to test things as I added them instead of waiting until the end. That made it easier to catch mistakes early and build on what was already working. Over time, I noticed my mindset changing—I wasn’t just writing code to make things work, but building a structure that could grow and be reused for other projects. I’ve come to really appreciate how iteration, or making small improvements in stages, can make a big difference in creating something smooth and reliable.

Working with computer graphics has shown me how creative computer science can be. It’s not just about writing code—it’s about bringing ideas to life. This project helped me understand how visuals, logic, and design all work together. Those skills will definitely help me as I move forward, whether I’m working on new courses or professional projects. Learning to create 3D visuals and interactive environments opens doors to so many fields—like game design, animation, data visualization, or even virtual reality. Most importantly, it’s taught me to look at problems from both a creative and technical perspective. I now see computer science as a way to tell stories and solve problems at the same time, and that’s something I’m really excited to keep exploring.
